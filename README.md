# stream - the Simple Transmission Emitter And Monitor
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vale981/stream.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vale981/stream)

A simple daemon and web interface to manage `ffmpeg` processes to
transcode `rtsp` to `rtmp` on affordable hardware (i.e. a raspberry
pi). This is the successor to the `doccam-*` projects (where * =
[pi](https://gitlab.com/vale9811/doccam-pi) |
[server](https://gitlab.com/vale9811/doccam-server) |
[server-docker](https://gitlab.com/vale9811/doccam-server-docker)).

The aim is to further simplify the software and rely largely on well
established utilities for monitoring and tunneling: `systemd` and
`wireguard`.
